# Via `. PKGBUILD`, the `$arch` variable is set. For MINGW packages, it must be
# `any` (so that e.g. i686 packages can be installed into an x86_64 setup), but
# for MSYS packages, the variable's value is a Bash array, and `$arch` refers to
# the first array item (typically `i686`).
#
# We want to use `$arch` below to construct the exact file name of the package,
# and therefore need to be careful when `--architecture` specifies an
# architecture other than the first item of the `$arch` array: The i686 variant
# of the package might already have deployed successfully while the x86_64
# variant might not have, and we do _not_ want this script to prevent the latter
# from being deployed.
#
# To that end, if `--architecture` was specified _and_ if `$arch` isn't `any`,
# let's assume that `$arch` refers to a Bash array and override it to refer to
# the intended architecture.
